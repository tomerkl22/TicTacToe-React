# TicTacToe-React

To play tic-tac-toe, each player takes turns placing their symbol (either an X or an O) on an empty space on the grid. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all of the spaces on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
